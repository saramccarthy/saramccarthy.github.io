My research focuses heavily on Artificial Intelligence, Game Theory and Decision Theory, Optimization and Learning (with rigorously reviewed publications at top conferences such as AAAI, IJCAI, AAMAS). At a high level I look at planning problems, mainly in the context of security, where we might be tasked with determining the best deployment and day to day use of resources as well operational planning (long term investments, managing budget for investments, choosing the best combination of resources). Some challenges that come up here are designing adaptive strategies, reasoning and planning under uncertainty, dealing with complex scheduling constraints, and solving massive scale games.

A large part of my work is developing solution methods that are usable in the real world. I have worked with Panthera, WWF and other NGOs, developing game theoretic algorithms to help protect the national parks and wildlife against deforestation and poaching. I have also been working with the TSA on optimizing passenger screening at airports around the US. The aim of all these projects is to develop solutions which are not only novel and academically interesting but also deployable with a real world impact.
