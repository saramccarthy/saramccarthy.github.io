The goal of this work is to develop efficient and effective game theoretic methods for preventing attacks in a secure area. While there are many different ways one may defend these areas, an effective way is to screen for threats (people, objects) before entry. This is a standard practice throughout the world, e.g., screening resources are used to secure border crossings, sports stadiums, government buildings, etc. In all of these scenarios, the screener is faced with the challenge of having a very large volume of items to be screened, and a very limited number of screening resources available to screen them with, making it critical for them to carefully plan the use of these limited resources in order to maximize the effectiveness of any defence strategy.

Threat Screening Games (TSG) are a game theoretic model, developed in collaboration with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which address these specific challenges by allowing the defender to remain unpredictable to a strategic adversary through randomized screening, allowing for more effective use of limited screening resources, leading to improved security. 

However there are several challenges that are present in solving these types of games, namely

<strong> Dynamic Risk Management </strong>  
We want to comprehensively assess risk on an individual basis and design a dynamic screening strategy for different risk levels, traffic volumes, and resource availability.

<strong> Team Formation </strong>  
We have many different screening resources
with differing efficacies, capacities and costs that may be combined
to work in teams.

<strong> Real World Uncertainty </strong>    
We need to deal with uncertainty in when screenees arrive 
and design an adaptive screening strategy based on past information.
